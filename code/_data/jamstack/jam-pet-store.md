I love Cats 🐈. Happy paws is a pet store app for our customers to purchase some adorable Cats. Customers can buy cats by adding their details to the cart 🛒 and then finally checkout by completing the payment process 💳.

This Jamstack e-commerce application is built using,

- Stripe: A complete payment platform with rich APIs to integrate with.
- Netlify Serverless Lambda Function: Run serverless lambda functions to create awesome APIs.
- Gatsbyjs: A React-based framework for creating prebuilt Markups.
